  " It's 2025. We are back. ",
  "I wrote Feeling Fresh after our first break, but two of our five people are missing. So how fresh could we really be? ",
  "Yeah, we are feeling fresh. Everyone else is. Yeah, we are halfway back. Yo, what is going on? People of the internet. Welcome back to another episode of the Waveform Podcast is 2025. We're your hosts? I'm Marquez. I'm ",
  "Andrew. And I'm ",
  "David. And okay, so we're mostly back. Ellis and Adam are both a little sick, taking a little bit of time to get better. Rightfully so. At the desk today, Mariah producing. She has all the buttons, she has all the trivia questions. It's gonna be a good time. Ah, ",
  "There already on. Ready? Ready? ",
  "I'm ready. Thank you Mariah. Yeah. Wow. We have a, a kind of a, a mix of things 'cause we took a little bit of time off. So there's been a stuff piling up that we wanna talk about. A little bit of CES stuff I should say. A lot of CES, it's ",
  "Mostly CEO ",
  "Stuff that's happening now and that's a lot of, it's a lot of stuff but it's like a lot of empty calories. It's like just headline after headline after headline. New stuff, new stuff, new stuff. We'll talk about some of it, but what'd you guys get into over break? Did you have any fun? Anything, any stories you wanna tell? ",
  "I have a New Year's Day story that is tech related. Okay. And if you follow me on Blue Sky, I might have physically or digitally seen me pulling my air out. ",
  "Oh, I know what you're ",
  "Talking about. Okay. So do I follow you on air? I spent my entire not, no, I probably do. I pretty sure you do. ",
  "I probably do. ",
  "I spent my entire New Year's day because over break Claire And I noticed that our Google Home, when you asked at the time or the weather would not respond and it wasn't like the, I can't help you with that now. It would just spin, like spin or light up and just like play the animation and nothing would happen. Mm. So at first I was like, I'm way too busy. Whatever. New Year's day when you have a 1-year-old, you're in bed way before midnight the night before. So New Year's day isn't is just, just another ",
  "Day. I didn't stay until the ball dropper. ",
  "Yeah. Not even remotely. Oh man. If I made it to 10:00 PM I'd be surprised. Okay. So New Year's day, I'm like, I'm gonna fix this. I have a pretty chill day. It can't be that hard. Long story short, it was very hard And I wound up flipping the breaker on my entire house. Oh My gosh. I reset every Google home I had. Wow. I disconnected every single smart home device from my network and re-added them all in nothing. ",
  "Why was it so important to get your Google home working? Because ",
  "The weather is like, one of the things I asked my Google home the most. I need to know the weather. It's so nice. Well, you just look at ",
  "Your phone. It is a Yeah, ",
  "I can, but like when I'm getting changed in the morning, like after the shower, it's way easier to say what's the weather? Do I need? It's part of the routine. Like it's part of the routine for ",
  "Sure. You know, I flip the breaker of my house every morning when I get up too, just to make sure I can check the weather. No, no, no, no, ",
  "No. I I, that was the one time thing to try and fix everything. Yeah. Yeah. Tech support. ",
  "But ",
  "Long story short, and the, the moral of this story is in tech, when something is wrong, always check the simplest version of the problem. And what I did after doing all of these stupid things for hours and hours is I went on my phone And I disconnected it from the wifi And I asked it the weather and it did the same thing, which meant it had nothing to do with my devices or my internet, which meant that it was a Google issue. So then I spent the rest of the day adding all of my smart home devices back onto my account. And then the next day I get tagged in like 30 different times from different articles. That's like Google's having some sort of issue. ",
  "Yeah. Only doing the weather and the time. Oh wow. It was only those specific things. So yeah. Wow. There's a million things that went through my head of what could've been wrong. Yeah. Yeah. It was Google's fault. ",
  "This is the reason every support person is like, sir, is your computer on I ",
  "100%? Is the monitor plugged in? Yeah. Is it lying on the ground right now? That ",
  "Probably is the issue. Like 60% of the time it, ",
  "It's, I did very little like tech support and it's almost always the like, dang, dang. Turn it back on. Yeah. Turn ",
  "It off. Turn it back on. Yeah, it works most of the time. Wow. Im sorry for you's And I hope you can now ask the weather to your robot. ",
  "I can and good. And they tell me that it is very cold, cold to New Jersey. It's very cold. Cold. ",
  "It's cold. It just says it's cold. It's definitely cold. It cold. Wow. ",
  "Yeah. That's how you started your year. ",
  "That's how I talking ",
  "Year can't wait. What happens the rest of the year for you? ",
  "I, ",
  "Any more days. ",
  "If it happens again, I'll be throwing all of my Google stuff out of the window. I can tell, I can guarantee that. ",
  "Well just Google it first. Make sure it's not ",
  "Yeah, ",
  "Yeah, yeah. You know, a service side issue. Dang. Yeah. I had a fun, I had a, a weird story. That was it, it wasn't supposed to be a story, but it turned out to be a story, which was I, I sold my cyber truck. I don't dunno if you saw the headlines. ",
  "Yes. ",
  "Now I Why are there headlines? Yeah. This is the thing. So I've, I, you guys knew and a lot of people who follow the channels know I had both a cyber truck and a Rivian R one T and we got them, we ordered them around the same time not knowing which would show up first. And we were gonna use them for our car videos for the tow hitch rig, for the stuff that we set up and get rollers of cars for. And we still use 'em for that. And I mean, I, they're kind of the sa they're the same thing. They're both a big expensive electric truck, so I don't need both of them. Yeah. So I was trying to decide which one we were gonna keep. And at one point I realized that this cyber truck had been sitting in the garage for like a month And I was just using the rivian for all the things I was normally using it for and for the tow hitch stuff. And for any like picking up stuff, I was like, okay, I think we've made our choice. ",
  "It's, it's the rivian that I prefer. And so started the process of selling a cyber truck, found a private seller, sold it. So I posted an Instagram story, sold a cyber truck just for the people who knew that we were still picking and now you know which one I picked. Within 12 hours of that there were like CBS news headlines that mark, that this influencer had picked, you know, over Elon Musk's precious cyber truck. And there were all these reactions from Tesla fans and you know, I, I only posted the Instagram story. There wasn't really any context. So I'd eventually updated people on like why I picked the rivian. ",
  "There's, they're very similar trucks. I like a lot of things about each of them. But I picked the rivian the funny part about that was one of the headlines was that oh, Marquez and Elon unfollowed each other on, on Twitter. ",
  "The way I saw it was our subreddit said Marquez unfollowed Elon and then ",
  "Some others I ",
  "Think on Blue Sky I saw, which then I went onto Twitter to see was Elon unfollowed Marquez? Yeah. And so I think I came in the morning being like, saw that unfollowing thing. Sorry, that's like blowing up. ",
  "Yeah. And I, I, the funny thing is I didn't unfollow Elon at, at all. I woke up to find that my account had unfollow el. What what I assume happened was, you know how you can, like, if someone's like going nuts, remove un follow or you can or you can like block and unblock sort of soft unfollow so they don't know that they unfollow you. Does that force 'em to unfollow you If you Yeah, if you block someone, they can't follow you anymore. So If you like block them and unblock them, they'll stop seeing your stuff ",
  "Because there's no notification that you got blocked. Wait, so are, ",
  "Did he block you? So I was following you. He tweets a ton And I, I don't really have any like political followers. Like I tweet, I follow people who I wanna see their stuff And I don't follow people who, I don't wanna see their stuff. So Elon is tweeting a lot. I don't know if you noticed it's, and it was getting close where I was like, do I mute him? I still wanna see like the important stuff, but there's just too much stuff now. And then when I saw that I was like, wait. Yeah, I just realized I haven't seen any Elon so much timeline like a couple of days. So I assume he like did something blocked, either blocked and unblocked or like well, so now they changed the block how the block thing works so that you can still see their content. If you go to their profile, you just can't engage with it. Yeah. So maybe he think he's still blocking you. ",
  "My theory is, no, he didn't block me. Well it'll still say I'm not blocked now say ear blocked. My theory is he just went block unblock so that I'm no longer following the account. ",
  "Yeah. See So If I just say that ",
  "You're blocked ",
  "Only if you catch it in the time that it's happening. So like if I go to you right now, don't block me. I can you block him real ",
  "Quick. ",
  "I can you block me real quick. Block you. Oh shit. All right. So now if you go to my page, ",
  "It doesn't say ",
  "Anything. No, it says no. It says Andrew Mike Elli has blocked you. Oh it does. So now if I unblock you ",
  "Then I won't be following the page anymore. ",
  "But you're not following me ",
  "Anymore. Yeah. ",
  "Cool, cool, cool. So look, no confirmation that's what ",
  "Happened. No confirmation. I'm just saying I just noticed that I had not, I'm, I wasn't seeing this stuff anymore. I don't know how personally that guy is taking me, selling my cyber truck. But long story short, yeah the rivian is, is pretty good at all the things we use it for. I miss things about the cyber truck. Don't get it wrong. I miss the larger second row, the larger bed, the way better speakers, the four four wheel steering. There's a lot of things that are better about the cyber truck but there are also things that are better about the rivian including being smaller and more nimble. Parking New York City with that thing I have, I like the design better. I like the gear tunnel better. I like a lot of the materials and the build and fit and finish better. So there's things on each side. But I picked one and that was that. But that was, that was what happened over break for me. ",
  "So yeah, everyone dramatizes everything now. That's a fact. ",
  "You don't wanna read about that ",
  "The car. It's a fact ",
  "Because it's not a story. It's not. I wish, well the ",
  "Story was like once the Twitter drama happened then it's a story for them. The funny thing is it wasn't even Twitter drama 'cause you didn't even do anything. Yep, yep. It's Twitter drama that happened to you manufactured. Wow. I would say. But here we are. Well my break was much less dramatic than both of yours. Nice. I just went to California And I went to my rattlesnake den that I grew up in. ",
  "What does that mean? On top of, ",
  "Wait, not a literal rattles Ry do you not have one? ",
  "No. What is a rattlesnake den? ",
  "So Am I. Yeah. I told you guys how, how Chuck Yeager like ruined my childhood. Right. The guy that broke the sound barrier. I vaguely remember some of, and like the street is changed names or something. Yeah. Like my mom named it and then he bought my road and then he renamed it to Chuck Yeager Road. Oh yeah. Yeah. Anyway, that road that at the top of the road on the top of a mountain is a rattlesnake den that my parents did not know was a rattlesnake den when they built the house on top of it. An actual rattles snake. An actual rattlesnake den. Oh okay. ",
  "So ",
  "Like we just had tons of rattlesnakes all the time. Regardless. I went back there, haven't been there since I was like 15 And I was really afraid of getting shot 'cause there was lots of signs that were like, do not come here. Like back off like all this stuff 'cause it's in the middle of nowhere. But I went up to the house And I knocked on the door and a very nice lady let me in. She is like, yeah this lot was just sitting here for like four years. We bought it from the bank for like nothing. And then they remodeled it and it was cute And it was weird. Yeah. ",
  "Yeah. I'm just imagining you grew. So ",
  "You went back to the house that you that I grew up in, grew up in. Yeah. I've thought about doing that. It was crazy. Yeah, because I, I haven't been there since I was like 14, which means more than half my life I have not been associated with that area. So it feels like I watched, it feels like a long time ago I watched a movie that was my childhood. You know, I, I might've told you guys this already, but a very high percentage of the dreams that I have take place in the house. I grew up in really 90, in plus percent ",
  "Elementary school ",
  "In the school. 90. ",
  "Just like wandering the halls And I want to go back to my old school so bad. Yeah. It just like walked the halls And I don't if that would, I'm gonna get arrested if I ",
  "Do. Yeah, don't do that without being announced. Don't do that. ",
  "Don't do that. Please. ",
  "I did go to my high school 'cause I brought a friend with me And I wanted to show her like everything about my childhood. So I showed her my high school but it was not open when we went. It was on a weekend. But you could still get in. Wait, you ",
  "Went in. ",
  "Well it's, there's no inside really. It's like an all outdoor California, ",
  "Right? Oh yeah. Florida. ",
  "It's like living in a movie. ",
  "Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know if visiting the house would like solve that or what, but I, I've driven past it a few times. That still happens to you? The dreams to this day, 90 something percent of the dreams that I have are either, that's in my bedroom on the stairs between the bedroom and the kitchen or in just around that house. That's ",
  "Wild. You should keep like a dream journal where you wake up maybe and you write it all down. ",
  "Yeah. Yeah. ",
  "And then we analyze it on the podcast next week. ",
  "Yeah. One of them recently was on the block of the house. It wasn't in the house but it was like I rode my bike down the block a lot. Whoa dang. Yeah. Anyway. Yeah. So yeah, mine was fairly undramatic. I sailed around San Francisco around the Bay On's sailboat. It was really cool. I couldn't go to Lake Tahoe 'cause the pass was snowed over but, And I told you guys this before the podcast started, I started the screen time thing on my phone to see how much time I was gonna use my phone every day. And it was like 24 minutes a day. That's crazy. Which was incredible. It was just my brain four was healed. ",
  "Mine was the opposite. Yeah. I had to get those 45 wins and poke 'em on the card game. And that took a lot of screen time. Yeah. And I did do it though. ",
  "Oh speaking the phones. So I did review the one plus 13. I really like that phone a lot. There's a lot of good things about it. The main pillars of the review are that there are three things about that phone that are really, really good. But our trends and that are going to be really, really good about a lot of phones in 2025. The Snapdragon eight Elite is amazing. Is battery great high-end performance, great gaming. Was that overheating at all? Never. No. No issues at all. Okay. So I, I marked that as a win for that chip. The 6,000 million hour battery, the carbon, what are we calling it? Silicon carbon battery again. Awesome. Like the battery in that phone obviously having a lot of capacity is great. But it also managed the battery. ",
  "Great. Could not kill it in a day. Not even if I tried. Wow. I had like a day where I drove back and forth home and then picked my parents up from the airport and came back and like high brightness, Waze, navigation the whole time stream Bluetooth like five hours of ways. Navigation for the day. Hmm. ",
  "Ways navigation with no, not plugging in. Feels ",
  "That feels like you're trying to kill your ",
  "Goal. Yeah, it ",
  "Feels because I was, I was like I will not plug this phone in. And I got to the end of the day it was like, yeah, no problem. 44% ready to go. Thanks. So battery, amazing chip amazing. And then the screen, like we've seen this for like the past year or so, but it's gonna keep happening. You're gonna get phones with like 4,000 knits peak brightness in HDR and like 1500 knits of full screen brightness and high brightness mode. Great screen. I could, I could see it all the time outside no matter what I tried to do. So I love that phone. It, it has also like nailed the other fundamentals. There's some weird quirks in oxygen os I don't love but the thing that's keeping me from using it as a daily is it doesn't have wifi calling on at t and so I can't, there's not good enough signal in this studio. Yeah, yeah, yeah. ",
  "Yeah. And so I can't keep using it. I'm missing important calls. ",
  "This is something I found out with my Zen phone is that, And I think I remember Pleaing to people is like the phone, it has wifi calling right? ",
  "Yeah. The feature is available. Carrier has to be, has to turn it on, ",
  "Has be approved on. That's really annoying that like carriers apparently have to whitelist it. Yeah. Is And I think that's what I originally found out with T-Mobile after Yeah. Hours of talking to them and they ",
  "Probably won't really do any phone that they don't sell. Yep. Is basically the ones they sell are the ones that get approved. So thep Pixel, the iPhone of the Samsung, the major ones, they all work and OnePlus phones for years on at and t have not had wifi T-Mobile. Do they still sell one plus phones? 'cause they had that deal with OnePlus when the OnePlus six T first came out where they started selling one plus the reason I ",
  "Thought Verizon was the one OnePlus people. ",
  "No, they always like, it always sort of worked on Verizon but not officially. Oh ",
  "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I ",
  "Get right. Yeah. They had like unofficial support for Verizon. Yeah. There's like years of forum posts from like years and years of OnePlus phones for people on at and t being like, hey does wifi calling not work? So annoying. It's, it's been true for a long time. I remember I had this with the one plus seven, I wanted to use wifi calling and it didn't, it looks like ever show up. They don't looks like, see Mobile has a couple do they? Plus unless I'm looking at an old page because I went to their website And I went to smartphones and then I went to brands and there is a one plus like filter but when you click it it has no results. Nothing. Yeah. So they at one point sold some one plus phones. Yeah. Either way I like that phone enough that I would daily it the camera as a weakness. Being a B plus camera is totally fine. So yeah that that was a good, that was a good phone. ",
  "That was the first review of the year. Go watch that video if you haven't already, we'll link it below. ",
  "I have kind of a segue from that. Yes. So one thing with the one plus phone is it has their first party cases, which is something OnePlus does. Oh yeah. Very good. All the time. Actually I brought some in and they have these magnets for like mag safe. One question. We've had a lot of that we kind of got the answer to this week at CES. ",
  "Unfortunately. Unfortunately ",
  "Is so the, the WPC, the Wireless Power Consortium Yeah. Lists Chee two as needing the magnets and we are chee two purists here. That's right. While Afeela Chee two purist Ben Schon. Yeah. Wrote two articles at CES so far. One about Samsung having QE two ",
  "'cause they announced that they would exactly in Galaxy devices. ",
  "And then like a day later the WPC announcing that QE two will have a ",
  "Sub A subdivision. ",
  "Two extensions. ",
  "Extensions right to ",
  "Q chetu. Yeah. One of them being something called Chee two ready. I hate everything. Which I know from them says the growth of the CHE two ecosystem will continue with the introduction of chee two ready certified devices. These devices, smartphones and accessories such as cases deliver the full chee two user experience when paired together in approved combinations. ",
  "Okay. But you have to have two things. I know. Yes. So it's a full experience. But if you also buy the accessories, I just point out it was like, it was like three weeks ago that that the guy from the wireless power consortium was like I need to make something very clear for something to be QE two it must have magnets. Technically ",
  "That is still true. I for something to be CHE two ready. Yeah. Which is like the official naming of it different, not just that it is is ready for CHI two. It is called chee two ready ",
  "Semantics Ruin the ruin the world. I hate it. ",
  "So yeah, as long if the, the wireless coil inside of the phone meets the Chee two specifications minus the magnets. It is not Q2 but if it has But it ready but it an approved case. No, no, no. As long as it has an approved case from Q2 with the magnets that line up correctly, it can then be CHE two ready. Yeah. ",
  "Yeah. Back my take don't, ",
  "Mariah is well on. She was, she must have practicing yesterday. She's ready. ",
  "My take is, so I was using the phones And I was, I was happily enjoying that. I could slap a case on and then drop it on any mag save accessory but marque. And so, so the way I phrased it in the video was like, okay, I'm an, I'm a no case person 'cause there's two sides of this. I'm a no case person And I literally in the rivian, I have one of these cases so that when I go drive, I sit down, I put the case on And I pop it in the dash that I can use space. Doesn't need to be this way. And when I get out the car, I take the case off And I go inside. Oh My gosh. But the other side of that is, let's be honest, most people use a case And I know, So If you just spend 20, $30 or whatever it is, yes it's an upcharge but it's as good for most people it's as good as having, but then also in order to be like officially QE two, it's going to have, it's going to need a QE two ready certified case. ",
  "And that certification is going to cost money. So the case won't be cheap. So it's either the case won't be cheap or the random case that you buy on Amazon will say it's ready but won't actually be officially Chee two ready and Then it won't really work quite as well. Or I don't even, there's probably, I don't think that they have like a microcontroller that says this is a Chee two case. 'cause you know how Apple when you put an official MagSafe case on it. Yeah. That's a little special animation. 'cause it knows, I think there, I think there might be might at the the, so there's like the magnet here also. This is, this found out T two, I don't it's T two ready. The ",
  "Was this I don't, or it just a magnet 13 ",
  "Said, oh, maybe it's not cheat two, I think they just have a magnet in the case. Yeah. 'cause OnePlus never used the words cheat tube. Correct. But they were, they literally, maybe I shouldn't say this, but in the press briefing they said this works with MagSafe. They told me this works with MagSafe. So they're like use use MagSafe accessories. And I was like, they won't market it that way. They're not gonna publicly say that they, they also have this little thing up here by the NFC chip. So maybe that has something to do with telling the phone the case is on. Oh, interesting. They each have that. Okay. Either way it worked with everything MagSafe. So it would mission accomplished as far as I'm, yeah, I mean the main thing with Q2 is like they want the magnets to align perfectly so you can get the highest rate of charging possible because Q2 standard is going to evolve over time to allow you to pump more power into your phone. ",
  "Yeah. And they need to make sure that the, the coils are perfectly aligned. And it is because otherwise it's meh. ",
  "It is nice that there's some sort of standard that these cases have to be to get that, which means we're getting the best possible way for it. Yeah. And honestly, like you said, there's two people. There's case people. ",
  "I, I mean I want it in the phone. ",
  "I know, let's be clear. But I, I think the difference is everyone outside of listening to this podcast uses a case, uses the case and if they get the first party one, it's perfect. Yeah. For people in this room and or listening to this podcast, put it in the, I think that's where we have the people that might be like, please put it ",
  "In the just intense irony of all these companies being like, we etched a special S pattern into the back of the device glass and the emerald green reflects our heart. Something like that. You know, it's like, it's like stuff like that. And then they're like, but you're gonna put a case on it. Right? Yeah. I will be giving points. I will be giving phones extra credit this year for building in the magnets. Put it that way. Thank you. I will be appreciating those extra. If you're gonna build in these special silicon carbon batteries or whatever that have more density, then you have more room to put a magnet. True. But they're putting so many big batteries in these phones. That's true. The numbers of the one plus 13 battery, 6,000 milliamp powers. Yeah. Compared directly with the one plus 12. The phone is thinner. Yeah. ",
  "Lighter and has 600 more milliamp powers of battery finally. That's amazing. I remember being like 12 years old and seeing all these articles and Wired being like, the battery of the future has just been invented and it will be in your stuff really soon. And Then it never came. It's graphene. So it's just, well, graphene was the main one. But it's always like, this professor just discovered a new way to have unlimited power density and Yeah, it's, ",
  "It's funny because even the silicon carbon one, it's not just silicon carbon because silicon carbon swells so badly. Yeah. It's a, that it's like a, it's like a ",
  "Yeah, with like salt. Yeah. But it works. These phones are lasting forever pretty. So I'm happy about that. Yeah, I'm glad we're gonna see that a lot more. We have a lot more to talk about with CES et cetera. So we'll get to that in a second. But before we do that, let's take a quick break and do some trivia. Trivia. ",
  "Ah dude, I think that's the longest I've gone without hearing that jingle. ",
  "Two weeks. You didn't play head every day just to hear it Once in ",
  "A while. When I arrive at my destination in my car. Wow. Wake up in a cold sweat to that ",
  "Sound. Well as you know, CES 2025 is here and we've already seen some bangers come out, but it wouldn't be CES without some absolutely heinous products. I did not make this list. I want you to know that. And so the question for you is, which of the following is not a real product? I knew this. ",
  "These are always the best. This could be anything. Yeah. ",
  "Okay, so we have a couple options for you. Option A is a razor heated and cooled gaming chair. Option B is a 3D printer that prints cake batter and bakes it with a laser. That sounds like a lot. ",
  "That ",
  "Sounds dope as hell. That's crazy sound. I want that option C Samsung stretchable display that just sort of bulges out sometimes. ",
  "Like bubbles. ",
  "Unclear in what ",
  "Direction. ",
  "This is an S in and Adam writing. I've got 40 D option D mirror mimy, I don't know, a furry little companion bought that's real. That imitates. It's always real imitates a shy infant and stealing glances nearby people while clinging to a bag strap. That is, that's a title from the Verge. That's real. ",
  "That's, that's gotta be real. That's crazy. Allegedly. I have no question. I've seen that. I've definitely seen that before. ",
  "That's in your dreams. And then option ",
  "E. Wait, there's ",
  "Five questions, options. Option E is just, they're all real. Oh. Oh. So I'll let you simmer on that. Think about that and we'll come back. ",
  "Man this is a trick. Que is it a trick question that it's a trick question. That's the best I want it to. Yeah, well, okay. We'll think about that. Answers will be at the end, like usual. We'll be right back. ",
